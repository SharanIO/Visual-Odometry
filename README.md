# Stereo Visual Odometry

Stereo Visual Odometry (SVO) is an advanced, modular computer vision project that accurately estimates camera motion through 3D space by processing sequential stereo images. This implementation uses the ROS framework to perform stereo visual odometry in real-time, taking advantage of stereo camera calibration, depth calculation, and odometry visualization in a unified pipeline. With a focus on robotics applications, this project is designed to be both flexible and efficient, compatible with various stereo datasets and capable of integrating seamlessly with the ROS ecosystem.

To achieve precise motion estimation, the pipeline begins with **stereo camera calibration**, calculating the intrinsic matrix and publishing it as a ROS topic. This calibration step provides a foundation for accurate depth perception, which is then calculated from the stereo images in the ROS bag and published as a dedicated ROS topic. Using the depth data, SVO is performed on the image stream, generating odometry estimations that are visualized in **RViz** alongside the ground truth odometry from the ROS bag.

This project also makes extensive use of **OpenCV** tools to handle feature detection, matching, and depth calculation tasks, ensuring a streamlined integration of image processing with the ROS framework. By combining efficient algorithms with a scalable, ROS-compatible design, this SVO project represents a reliable solution for real-time visual odometry in dynamic environments, ideal for applications in autonomous navigation and SLAM.
