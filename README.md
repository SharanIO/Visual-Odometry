# Stereo Visual-Odometry

This project demonstrates a Stereo Visual Odometry system built with ROS, aimed at enabling accurate depth perception and motion estimation in dynamic environments. The system consists of three integrated components: Camera Calibration, Depth Estimation, and Odometry Calculation. Each component is designed to publish data as ROS topics, allowing for real-time processing and seamless integration with other robotic systems.

This project showcases not only my technical skills in robotics software development but also an understanding of essential robotic perception tasks. These skills are directly transferable to more complex projects such as autonomous navigation, robotic manipulation, and real-time scene understanding, making this a valuable asset for companies looking to integrate visual odometry and depth sensing into their robotic systems.
