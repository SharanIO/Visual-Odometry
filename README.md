## üìñ Project Overview

Stereo visual odometry estimates a camera-equipped robot‚Äôs position and orientation by analyzing stereo image pairs. By deriving depth from stereo images, we can compute incremental motion over time, allowing the robot to navigate and interact in dynamic environments. This README details the technical breakdown of the project's three main components:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Components

1. **Camera Calibration**
   - **Purpose**: Captures intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters using a checkerboard pattern to correct image alignment.
   - **Published Topic**: `/camera_calibration`
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     roslaunch your_package_name camera_calibration.launch
     ```

2. **Depth Estimation**
   - **Purpose**: Converts stereo images into depth data, providing valuable 3D information for robot perception.
   - **Published Topic**: `/depth_estimation`
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     roslaunch your_package_name depth_estimation.launch
     ```

3. **Stereo Visual Odometry**
   - **Purpose**: Computes the robot's motion by analyzing depth and motion cues from stereo frames.
   - **Published Topic**: `/odometry_data`
   - **Visualization**: RViz (with additional ROS bag replay for robustness testing)
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     roslaunch your_package_name stereo_visual_odometry.launch
     ```

Each component publishes data as ROS topics, supporting real-time processing and enabling integration with other robotic systems for a seamless operational workflow.
